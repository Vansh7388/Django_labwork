        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2010, the Computer Science Club at the University of Windsor has been dedicated to fostering a community of learning, innovation, and collaboration among students interested in technology and computer science. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application by providing hands-on experiences and industry connections.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, we have grown from a small group of enthusiastic students to one of the most active and influential clubs on campus. We believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and strive to prepare our members for successful careers in the tech industry.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Achievements and Goals</h2>
        <p>
            We are proud of our accomplishments and continue to set ambitious goals for the future. Our club has organized numerous successful events, mentored hundreds of students, and maintained strong relationships with tech companies in the region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking ahead, we aim to expand our reach, introduce more innovative programs, and continue being a catalyst for technological advancement within our university community.
